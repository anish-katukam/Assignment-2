# Assignment-2

Hey,  TA/grader, I recognize now that perhaps I shouldn't have added the JavaDoc comments for getHistory() in the second version because the method was not yet implemented. However, seeing as the first commit specifically asked for the JavaDoc comments to be added before the functionality was present, I thought it was fine to do the same to getHistory(). If this "should" result in a penalty, please pretend I added TODO: in front of getHistory() where relevant. If not, well, so be it.

Thanks!
